Please read through the [Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/geerlingguy/drupal-vm#quick-start-guide) to get started.

_Note that there are two methods of using Drupal VM; either you [download Drupal VM and configure the project for your site](../deployment/overview.md#download-drupal-vm-and-integrate-your-project), or you require it as a [Composer dependency in an existing project](../deployment/overview.md#add-drupal-vm-as-a-composer-depedency-to-an-existing-project)._

For a quick overview of how to get started and configuring Drupal VM to build a site, watch the the screencast below.
